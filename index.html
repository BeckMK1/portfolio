                <p class="mainText">My first firebase project. it was a group project where we were takst making
                    a web-app. gaming-match is a web-app about finding people to play videogames with.
                here the main challenge was to implement a login and signup functionality and with that a account system where the user would be able to save a profile image,
                 name and other user information.
                to do this i used firebase functionality.
                another think we needed was for the page to be a single page application. not only because it was apart of the assignment,
                 but also because it is a good way to cut down on load times by only loading the content needed.

                <h2>Playbet</h2>
                <p class="mainText">a prototype made for playground Entertainment as a group school project.
                    playbet is a live sport betting app hver you bet a fake currency that you can use on prizes.
                    first project where i used jquery, and one for my first javaScript projects. Note: look en
                    new code for final code.<br>
                   <br>for this app I needed to make the app respond to user input. since it is a betting game the user has a currency to spend en bets.
                    so the user has a pool of currency and each bet has a cost, so the functionality was to subtract a cost from a balance, but also to give the user some freed back.
                    this was done by changing the style of the interface. thereby telling the user that the bet went through.

                    redesign of Assens shipyard's website.
                    for this project most of the work was in CSS making the redesign look good and morden.
                    another important thing was to make a good and UI that was quick to use but had all the necessary information needed.
                    most of the javascript was used on small zoom effects for some of the images. but we also used mapbox with some costume icons. and I also made a small gallery.

                    order to attract more students.
                here i worked mostly on CSS and html with som input on the JavaScript.
                the goal was to give users a look into what the højskole is all about.
                since the højskole has a big focus on art we took inspiration in that.
                we used animation to make the site feel more alive. and much work was put in smooth scrolling and effect like it.
